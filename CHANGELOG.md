#Version 0.3.4 the-untouchables (2014-05-28)

##General
-Added a configuration option for skipping the intro screen (the tutorials list) if there's just one tutorial available for some context.

------------------------------------------------------------

#Version 0.3.3 raging-bull (2014-01-10)

##General
-Changed licensing to Apache License 2.0 (Now Sideshow is open source software bro! Yeah!!)
-Replaced Google Closure by UglifyJS; though Google Closure compress ratio is a higher (when in Advanced Mode), there are some issues with dead code detection and UglifyJS is considerably faster.
-Changed build script to resolve dependencies in a similar way as Sprocket does

------------------------------------------------------------
There's no changelog before the 0.3.3 version since we became public in this version.
